    <!-- Great! Here are some practical problems that will help you apply these topics: 

### 1. **Capitalizing Words in a Sentence**
   - Write a program that takes a sentence and capitalizes the first letter of each word.
   - **Hint**: Split the sentence into words, capitalize each, and join them back together.

### 2. **Vowel Counter**
   - Take a sentence as input and count how many vowels it contains (both uppercase and lowercase).
   - **Example**: For input "JavaScript is awesome," the output should be `8`.

### 3. **Extract Username from Email**
   - Given an email address, extract and display the username (everything before `@`).
   - **Example**: For "user@example.com," output should be `"user"`.

### 4. **Round Numbers in an Array**
   - Take an array of decimal numbers and round each to the nearest integer.
   - **Example**: For `[3.7, 2.4, 5.6]`, output should be `[4, 2, 6]`.

### 5. **Random Password Generator**
   - Generate a random 8-character password containing letters and numbers.
   - **Hint**: Use `Math.random()` for random numbers and characters.

### 6. **Character Replacement**
   - Ask the user for a sentence, then replace all instances of the character 'a' with '@' and 's' with '$'.
   - **Example**: For "Javascript is amazing," output should be `"J@v@$cript i$ @m@zing"`.

### 7. **Temperature Converter with Rounding**
   - Create a temperature converter from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Display the Fahrenheit temperature rounded to 1 decimal place.
   - **Formula**: \( F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \).

### 8. **String to Integer Sum**
   - Prompt the user for two numbers in string format, convert them to integers, and display their sum.
   - **Example**: For inputs `"15"` and `"30"`, output should be `45`.

### 9. **Check Word Presence in Sentence**
   - Take a sentence and a word as inputs. Check if the word is present in the sentence and display its starting position, or a message if not found.
   - **Example**: For "Learning JavaScript is fun" and word "JavaScript," output should be `"Found at position 9"`.

### 10. **Format Currency**
   - Take a decimal number as input and display it formatted to 2 decimal places as currency.
   - **Example**: For input `123.456`, output should be `"$123.46"`.

These problems will help you work with strings, numbers, and JavaScript's built-in methods! Let me know if you need hints or solutions for any of these. -->
